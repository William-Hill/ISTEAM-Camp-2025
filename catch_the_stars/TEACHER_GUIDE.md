- Particle effects when catching stars

### Lesson 5: Advanced Concepts (90 minutes)

**Objectives:**
- Implement complex game mechanics
- Work with data structures
- Optimize code performance

**Activities:**
1. **Advanced Features** (40 min): Implement complex mechanics
2. **Code Review** (20 min): Review and optimize code

4. **Documentation** (10 min): Document advanced features

**Advanced Concepts:**
- Lists and arrays for multiple objects
- State machines for game states
- File I/O for saving high scores
- Sound and music programming

## ü§ñ AI Integration Strategies

### 1. AI as a Programming Tutor
- Students ask AI to explain code concepts
- AI provides step-by-step guidance for modifications
- AI helps debug code issues

### 2. AI as a Code Generator
- Students describe features they want to add
- AI generates code examples
- Students modify and adapt AI-generated code

### 3. AI as a Learning Assistant
- AI explains programming concepts in different ways
- AI provides alternative solutions to problems
- AI suggests best practices and optimizations

### 4. AI as a Collaboration Tool
- Students share AI conversations about their code
- Class discusses different AI approaches
- Teacher uses AI to generate additional examples

## üìä Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment
- **Code Reviews**: Students explain their modifications
- **Debugging Challenges**: Students fix intentionally broken code
- **Feature Presentations**: Students demonstrate new features
- **AI Conversations**: Students show how they used AI for help

### Summative Assessment
- **Final Project**: Complete game with original features
- **Code Documentation**: Well-commented and organized code
- **Reflection Essay**: What they learned about programming
- **Peer Review**: Students review each other's games

### Rubric Example
```
Excellent (A):
- Game runs without errors
- Multiple original features implemented
- Code is well-organized and commented
- Effective use of AI for learning
- Creative and engaging gameplay

Good (B):
