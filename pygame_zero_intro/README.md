# 👽 Pygame Zero Tutorial: Alien Game

A complete recreation of the official Pygame Zero documentation tutorial game, perfect for beginners learning Python game development!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This tutorial covers the fundamental concepts of Pygame Zero game development:

- **Window Creation**: Setting up a game window with custom dimensions
- **Sprite Management**: Loading and displaying images as game objects
- **Game Loop**: Understanding the `draw()` and `update()` functions
- **Input Handling**: Responding to mouse clicks and detecting collisions
- **Audio Programming**: Playing sound effects when events occur
- **Animation**: Making sprites move and change appearance
- **Timing**: Using the clock to schedule events

```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Pygame Zero

Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed, then install Pygame Zero:

```bash
pip install pgzero
```

### 2. Generate Game Assets

Run this command to create the alien sprites and sound:

```bash
python3 create_alien_sprites.py
```

### 3. Run the Game

```bash
pgzrun intro.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Watch**: The alien moves across the screen from left to right
- **Click**: Click on the alien to make it look hurt
- **Listen**: Hear a sound effect when you click the alien
- **Observe**: The alien returns to normal after 1 second
- **Quit**: Press Ctrl-Q (or Cmd-Q on Mac) to exit

## 📚 Code Walkthrough

### Window Setup
```python
WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = 300
```
These variables control the size of your game window. Pygame Zero automatically uses these to create the window.

### Creating a Sprite
```python
alien = Actor('alien')
alien.pos = 100, 56
```
- `Actor('alien')` creates a sprite that loads `alien.png` from the `images/` folder
- `alien.pos` sets the sprite's position on screen (x, y coordinates)

### The Draw Function
```python
def draw():
    screen.fill((128, 0, 0))  # Red background
    alien.draw()              # Draw the alien
```
- Called every frame to paint the screen
- `screen.fill()` fills the background with a color (RGB values)
- `alien.draw()` displays the sprite at its current position

### The Update Function
```python
def update():
    alien.left += 2           # Move alien right
    if alien.left > WIDTH:    # If off screen
        alien.right = 0       # Reset to left side
```
- Called every frame to update game logic
- Moves the alien 2 pixels to the right each frame
- Resets the alien position when it goes off screen

### Mouse Input
```python
def on_mouse_down(pos):
    if alien.collidepoint(pos):  # Click on alien?
        set_alien_hurt()         # Make it hurt!
    else:
        print("You missed me!")  # Missed!
```
- Called when the mouse button is pressed
- `pos` contains the click coordinates
- `alien.collidepoint(pos)` checks if the click hit the alien

### Sound and Animation
```python
def set_alien_hurt():
    alien.image = 'alien_hurt'     # Change sprite
    sounds.eep.play()              # Play sound
    clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_normal, 1.0)  # Schedule reset
```
- Changes the alien's appearance to the hurt sprite
- Plays the "eep" sound effect
- Schedules the alien to return to normal after 1 second

## 🎨 Customizing the Game

### Change Colors
```python
# In the draw() function, change the background color
screen.fill((0, 128, 255))  # Blue background
screen.fill((255, 255, 0))  # Yellow background
```

### Change Speed
```python
# In the update() function, change movement speed
alien.left += 5  # Faster movement
alien.left += 1  # Slower movement
```

### Change Timing
```python
# In set_alien_hurt(), change how long the alien stays hurt
clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_normal, 2.0)  # 2 seconds
clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_normal, 0.5)  # 0.5 seconds
```

### Add More Sprites
```python
# Create additional sprites
player = Actor('player')
player.pos = 250, 150
player.draw()  # Add to draw() function
```

## 🧠 Learning Challenges

### Beginner Challenges
1. **Change the alien's color**: Modify the sprite generation script
2. **Add a score counter**: Track how many times you click the alien
3. **Change the background**: Try different colors or patterns
4. **Add more sound effects**: Create different sounds for different events

### Intermediate Challenges
1. **Multiple aliens**: Create several aliens moving at different speeds
2. **Alien movement patterns**: Make the alien move in different ways (bouncing, zigzag)
3. **Power-ups**: Add items that give the alien special abilities
4. **Timer display**: Show how long the alien has been hurt

### Advanced Challenges
1. **Alien AI**: Make the alien try to avoid your clicks
2. **Particle effects**: Add sparkles when you click the alien
3. **Level system**: Create different levels with increasing difficulty
4. **Save high scores**: Store the best score in a file

## 🤖 AI Integration

This tutorial is perfect for learning with AI assistance:

### Example AI Prompts
- "How do I make the alien move in a circle instead of straight?"
- "Can you explain what the clock.schedule_unique function does?"
- "I want to add a second alien. How would I do that?"
- "How can I make the alien change color when clicked instead of changing sprites?"

### AI Learning Tips
- Ask AI to explain any code you don't understand
- Use AI to suggest modifications and improvements
- Have AI help you debug any issues
- Ask AI to create variations of the game

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Image not found" errors**
   - Make sure `alien.png` and `alien_hurt.png` are in the `images/` folder
   - Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

2. **"Sound not found" errors**
   - Make sure `eep.wav` is in the `sounds/` folder
   - Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Game runs slowly**
   - Try reducing the movement speed in the `update()` function
   - Check if your computer meets the minimum requirements

4. **Alien doesn't move**
   - Make sure the `update()` function is defined correctly
   - Check that `alien.left += 2` is inside the function
